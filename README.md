## Why "Windows 7 Aero" Theme?
While the theme is far from set on stone at this point in development, Windows 7's Aero fascinated me as a teen with its eye catching transparency and shiny effects, the golden era of [Frutiger Aero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger_Aero). Oh, how I miss those days! 🧃

I used few Virtual Machines to collect the most data I could in order to faithfully recreate Windows 7's Aero in web - I also used few tools to extract icons from the shell (Action center, Volume, etc.).

I do not intend this to become a fully featured and functional desktop experience, but rather just a pretty face for what is essentially a page with my social links. 🐼

## TO-DO
 - [x] Mouse dragable windows
 - [ ] Reminiscent wallpaper from my teens
 - [ ] Working shortcut icons in desktop (My games, Apps, URLs, etc...)
 - [ ] If this becomes complex, use Angular to componentize everything.

 ## Third Party
 - [7.css](https://github.com/khang-nd/7.css) (The Windows 7 Aero CSS)
 - [TheBobPony's Windows 7 Parallels VM](https://www.reddit.com/r/windows7/comments/1i0ljgc/comment/mjyl0kx/)
